      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
        <p> Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I'm Leyla, a versatile individual with a background in both web
          development and the
          chemical industry. I hold a degree in Computer Science and have gained valuable experience as a quality
          assurance
          analyst over the course of several years. This role has allowed me to cultivate my abilities in leadership,
          process
          enhancement, and creative problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p> I have successfully completed an intensive bootcamp program where I acquired extensive knowledge and
          expertise in
          various programming languages and frameworks. These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. My
          primary focus
          lies in creating captivating web applications that prioritize user experience through intuitive design and
          seamless
          functionality. My dedication to technology and a constant thirst for innovation motivates me to consistently
          update my
          skill set and incorporate the latest advancements into my development projects.
        </p>

        <p> I am thrilled to engage with fellow professionals in the web development field who share my enthusiasm for
          innovation
          and personal growth. Please take a moment to explore my portfolio, and don't hesitate to contact me if you
          have any
          inquiries or potential collaboration opportunities. Thank you for taking the time to visit!
